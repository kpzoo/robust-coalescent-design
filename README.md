# robust-coalescent-design
Code for examining Fisher experimental design for coalescent processes. Reproduces (in raw form) plots in the manuscript 'Robust Design for Coalescent Model Inference' by KV Parag and OG Pybus: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/23/317438

1) The ellipseFish.m file produces design (uncertainty) ellipses for 2 parameter skyline coalescent processes.
2) The probSample.m file examines a square wave robust design problem as detailed in the supporting text of the manuscript.
